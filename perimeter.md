# Perimeter Institute

*Visiting Researcher*

Visiting the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics (PI), I was able to collaborate and engage with a collection of the top minds in theoretical physics today. My time was spent pursuing my research as well as in sharing ideas and participating in the wealth of seminars, lectures, and tutorials both through the Perimeter Scholars International programme and the PI as a whole.
