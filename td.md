# TD Securities (2016-)

I have been working in various Technology roles with the Toronto-Dominion Bank since 2016. During this time I've had the chance to grow as a Technologist, Data Scientist, and Finance professional. Some things that tie these experiences together are always jumping at opportunities to build community through shared knowledge and active teaching, and promoting a culture of ownership through evangelism.
