# Speaking

I am a big supporter of the Python and Jupyter communities and jump at the opportunity to attend and contribute back to them. Over the years this has amounted to organizing internal conferences to raise the profile of open source, Python and Jupyter in particular, attending many public conferences, countless posters, and [speaking at some](https://2019.pycon.ca/talks/talk-111/) prominent Python events. 

In addition to the Python/Jupyter world, I have been very happy to share my viewpoints for a number of events including:

* **BLK Capital Management Annual Conference** Data & Analytics in Finance Fireside Chat
* **BANK+IT 2021** Data Science Panel

I am always interested for more opportunities to help grow these communities through speaking engagements.
