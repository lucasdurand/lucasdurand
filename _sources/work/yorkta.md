# YorkU Physics (2014-2016)

*Teaching Assistant*

As a teaching assistant, I needed to maintain a broad knowledge of general science. This ranged from specific knowledge in undergraduate physics in order to mark a large volume of assignments and exams to practical knowledge used to run laboratory sessions, to general scientific knowledge used to lead an environmental science tutorial class for non-science students.

I worked to promote a holistic understanding of difficult topics through the use of qualitative, quantitative, analytic and synthetic thinking while efficiently assessing a high volume of studentproblem sets and assignments.
