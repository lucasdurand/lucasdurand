   - Ensures data accuracy, latency efficiency, and integration with downstream systems.
   - Works closely with traders, quants, and analytics teams to support real-time decision-making.

2. **Reference Data Masters**

   - Manages **static and semi-static reference data** (e.g., securities master, counterparties, corporate actions).
   - Maintains golden sources of truth for critical business operations (risk reporting, compliance).
   - Collaborates with front/middle office to streamline workflows impacted by reference data changes.

3. **Data Quality & Governance**

   - Establishes frameworks/metrics for **data integrity**, lineage tracking, and compliance.

   - Partners with Legal & Risk teams to enforce policies while enabling agile use cases.

4. **Data Science Engineering**
   - Provides scalable infrastructure/platforms (**Jupyter Notebooks**, ML pipelines) for broad quantitative analytics, reporting, AI, and upskilling.
   - Bridges gaps between research prototypes (Python/R) and production-grade deployments.
   - Supports AI/ML initiatives with clean datasets while ensuring reproducibility/monitoring.

#### **Strategic Leadership:**

- Define and execute platform roadmap aligned with C-suite objectives; secure buy-in from business stakeholders (trading, risk, finance).
- Lead cross-functional teams (engineering, architecture, governance) to modernize the dealer-wide Data Platform, focusing on cloud migration (Azure/GCP), data fabric/mesh adoption, and next-gen architecture.
- Develop and implement data governance and data quality technology strategy to provide near-realtime visibility into key _data products_.
- Transform market + reference data masters platforms for more reliable, trusted _golden source_ data, that vastly reduces manual efforts for workflows like client onboarding and data remediation.

### **Vice President, Data Science Engineering** _(2020–2023)_

**Team & Stakeholder Management:**

- Built and led a high-performing engineering team supporting Python infrastructure, notebooks-as-code, and analytics tooling.
- Acted as primary liaison between quant teams, IT security, and business units to align priorities and deliver.
- Deliver business-enabling notebooks, applications, and processes 10-25x faster than through traditional technology processes.
- Grow userbase organically to 1000+ users across technology, business, operations, and support teams.

**Technical Innovation:**

- Scaled JupyterHub deployments via Dask-on-YARN and Spark-on-YARN integrations.
- Architected enterprise-grade identity provider integration for JupyterHub, implementing OAuth 2.0, reducing auth-related development time while improving security posture "out of the box" to users.
- Pioneered "EUC Governance" framework to streamline self-service analytics while mitigating operational risk.

### **Software Engineer Technical Lead** _(2019–2020)_

**Technical Innovation & Platform Leadership**

- Led development of core Python libraries to provide a common interface for common data operations agnostic to the data sources (SQL, Spark, REST API) to kickstart development workflows, particularly for citizen developers
- Designed scheduling platform for recurring jobs with, becoming critical infrastructure for prototyping and EUC processes
- Created self-service deployment system for analytical applications that empowered business teams across front, middle, and back office to productionize dashboards without engineering support

**Project Leadership:**

- Architected TDSs first centralized JupyterHub+ platform (serving 400+ users), reducing prototyping time by 70%.
- Mentored junior engineers through code reviews and best-practice workshops (adopted org-wide).

**Awards:**

- **TDS Pinnacle Award of Achievement** (Top 0.1% performance).
- **TD Vision In Action Award** (1-in-1000 enterprise-wide recognition).

### Earlier Roles & Education
