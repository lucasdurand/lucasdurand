## Director, Data Platform & Analytics

### Scope
I lead a 30+ person organization spanning four teams: Market Data Masters, Reference Data Masters, Data Quality & Governance, and Data Science Engineering. Together, we own dealer-wide data platforms supporting trading, risk, compliance, and analytics, combining strategy, execution, and governance to deliver trusted, scalable data products across TD Securities.

_Leadership focus: building platforms that empower teams to move fast safely, using guardrails instead of gatekeepers._


### Signature Wins
- Led dealer-wide cloud migration and data fabric adoption, reducing legacy risk exposure and enabling ~50% faster time-to-market for analytics products.
- Established trusted market and reference data masters as golden sources, eliminating manual remediation and improving reliability for key processes across onboarding, risk, and reporting by 10x.
- Implemented near-real-time data quality monitoring and governance, cutting recurring "data fires" by ~80% and strengthening regulatory audit readiness.
- Scaled Jupyter-based analytics and ML platforms to 1,000+ users, reducing experimentation cycles from weeks to days (10–25× improvement).
- Secured C-suite sponsorship for a multi-year platform roadmap, aligning trading, risk, and finance priorities and driving ~$15M in operational efficiencies through automation.

## Vice President, Data Science Engineering

### Scope & Leadership
- Built and led a high-performing engineering team delivering Python infrastructure, notebooks-as-code, and analytics tooling.
- Served as primary liaison between quant teams, IT security, and business stakeholders to align priorities and unblock delivery.
- Enabled business teams to prototype analytics and applications 10–25× faster than traditional technology processes.
- Grew platform adoption organically to 1,000+ users across technology, business, operations, and support.

### Technical Execution
- Scaled JupyterHub deployments through Dask-on-YARN and Spark-on-YARN integrations.
- Architected enterprise-grade identity provider integration for JupyterHub using OAuth 2.0, improving security posture while reducing authentication-related development overhead.
- Pioneered an EUC governance framework that balanced self-service analytics with operational risk controls.

## Software Engineer Technical Lead

### Scope & Technical Leadership

- Led development of core Python libraries to provide a common interface for common data operations agnostic to the data sources (SQL, Spark, REST API) to kickstart development workflows, particularly for citizen developers
- Designed scheduling platform for recurring jobs, becoming critical infrastructure for prototyping and EUC processes
- Created self-service deployment system for analytical applications that empowered business teams across front, middle, and back office to productionize dashboards without engineering support

### Platform & Delivery Impact
