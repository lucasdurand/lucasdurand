# Leadership Overview

## Executive Summary

I am a data and technology leader focused on building **enterprise data platforms and operating models** that enable confident decision-making in complex, regulated environments.

Over the past decade, I have led teams responsible for market data, reference data, analytics platforms, and data quality and governance within global financial institutions. My work centers on transforming fragmented data landscapes into **trusted, decision-ready data products** that support front-office workflows, regulatory reporting, and enterprise analytics at scale.

I operate at the intersection of **strategy, platforms, and people**. I define multi-year roadmaps aligned to business priorities, build enabling platforms that scale across teams, and develop leaders who can own outcomes beyond individual projects. I am most effective in roles where data, analytics, and AI are treated as **strategic capabilities**, not just infrastructure.

## Operating Style

I lead through **clarity, ownership, and leverage**.

I start by aligning stakeholders on the decisions and outcomes that matter, then design platforms and operating models that allow teams to move quickly within clear guardrails. I delegate ownership to empowered leaders and hold teams accountable for measurable outcomes.

I favor **platforms over bespoke solutions**, strong defaults over ad hoc choices, and automation over manual controls. Governance is embedded directly into workflows through templates, policies, and observability so that trust is built continuously rather than enforced reactively.

I measure success not just by delivery speed, but by durability: reduced operational friction, fewer recurring incidents, and teams that can move independently without sacrificing quality or compliance.
