# Volunteering

Outside of strictly work endeavours I like to put aside time to give back to communities and causes. This is mostly in the form of mentorship (formal or informal) and playing music for charity.

## Mentorship

*UofT Arts & Sciences Mentorship Program*

I have been a mentor with the UofT Physics Mentorship program since 2014. This has been a very rewarding way to engage with current students and share perspective on life outside of academia, particularly for students considering a move outside of traditional or expect career paths.

## Charity Work

There are a number of great organizations I work with on an annual basis, typically through fundraising and performing live music:

* ABC for SickKids
* CANFAR - AIDSbeat
* March of Dimes - Rock for Dimes
* CIBC Run for the Cure
* Big Brothers Big Sisters of York
* CIBC Rock for LIFE
* AUSUM Charity for Autism
* Raising the Roof - Sounds of the 6ix

If you ever need a sax player for a show, let me know!
