*HBSc Joint Specialist, Physics & Philosophy*

My education focused around the intersections between Physics & Philosophy. I developed a deep understanding of the manner in which strict formalism in science blossoms in the presence of an open and self-critical perspective. By continuously questioning one's own methods and practices and investigating their connections with the big picture, one can greatly increase their own effectiveness.
