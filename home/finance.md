## Summary 

I got my start in finance 7 years ago... I broke from my studies in theoretical physics to take a seat on the trading floor of a major Canadian bank. During the two summers spent there, I simultaneously learned about Equities Trading, Python, and to always be watchful for errant nerf balls. Since then, I've taken on a number of roles across TD Securities with a focus on Quantitative Analytics and Data Science, always with a grounding in Technology.

More and more I see the power of outsiders in this industry, where unconventional backgrounds and broad skillsets catalyse big successes. I'm happy now to be bringing some otherworldly thinking to the stellar TD Securities Data & Analytics team as VP - Data Science Engineering.
