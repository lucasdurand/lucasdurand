This ([lucasdurand.xyz](http://lucasdurand.xyz)) is a working draft of my resume. It aims to highlight some of my achievements, announce current aspirations, and likely showcase a few Python and/or Data Science projects that I put together (if I get around to that part).

```{admonition} Lucas' pronouns ...
:class: tip
are best used in sentences like: **he** is incredibly talented. **His** experience and skillset will be a great complement to our team; we should hire **him**.
