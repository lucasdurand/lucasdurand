**Senior Data Leader Driving Scalable Platforms and Strategic Insights in Financial Services**

I’m a data and technology leader focused on building enterprise-grade data platforms **that actually get used**.

Over the past decade, I’ve led teams across data platforms, analytics, governance, and AI enablement at a global investment bank — partnering closely with front-office, risk, and technology leaders to turn data into a trusted business asset.

My work sits at the intersection of **strategy, platforms, and people**:

* Scaling analytics and data science platforms to thousands of users

* Modernizing market and reference data into product-oriented golden sources

* Establishing proactive data quality and governance without slowing delivery

* Growing leaders and building strong technical communities

I’m especially interested in roles where data platforms, AI, and analytics are viewed as strategic enablers, not just infrastructure.
