# Data Strategy Philosophy

## North Star

A data strategy only succeeds if people **trust the data, understand their ownership, and can act on it quickly**.

My philosophy is grounded in building data capabilities that support real decisions in complex, regulated environments -- where latency, correctness, and explainability all matter. The goal is not abstract "data maturity," but **decision-ready data products** that are reliable, observable, and aligned to business outcomes.

Strong data strategy turns data from a liability into a durable organizational asset.

## Core Principles

- **Data Is a Product**  
  Critical datasets are owned, curated, and evolved like products. They have clear owners, defined consumers, quality expectations, and lifecycle management.

- **Trust Is Essential**  
  Trust comes from consistency, transparency, and fast feedback. Quality, lineage, and freshness must be measurable and visible.

- **Federated Ownership, Centralized Enablement**  
  Domain teams own outcomes for their data, while centralized platforms provide shared infrastructure, standards, and leverage.

- **Platforms Scale People Better Than Pipelines**  
  Reusable platforms and opinionated defaults outperform bespoke pipelines. Well-designed platforms make the common path easy, the advanced path possible, and the unsafe path unnecessary.

- **Business Value First**  
  Data initiatives are evaluated by their impact on decision making, operational reliability, and real business value, not just technical KPIs.

## Operating Model

I favour a **platform-plus-domains** operating model.

Shared platform teams provide ingestion, compute, storage, analytics tooling, identity, and policy enforcement as reusable capabilities. Domain-aligned teams own specific data products and are accountable for their quality, usability, and downstream impact.

Standards are enforced through **automation and paved roads**, not manual review. Ownership is explicit, escalation paths are clear, and guardrails are designed to prevent common failure modes **without blocking innovation.**

This model enables scale while preserving accountability.

## Governance That Enables Delivery

Effective governance reduces friction rather than adding it.

I design governance to be:
- Automated wherever possible  
- Proportionate to risk  
- Intuitive to practitioners + stakeholders alike
- Embedded in platforms and CI/CD workflows  
- Observable and auditable by default  

This shifts organizations away from reactive controls and toward **preventative, self-correcting systems**, reducing recurring incidents and manual remediation.

## What Success Looks Like

Leading indicators include:
- Broad adoption of shared data platforms and self-service tooling  
- Clear ownership for critical data products  
- Reduced recurrence of known data issues  
- Faster turnaround from issue detection to resolution  

Lagging indicators include:
- Improved confidence in analytics and reporting  
- Reduced operational escalations related to data  
- Shorter time from question to actionable insight

## Anti-Patterns I Avoid

- Treating governance as a separate approval process  
- Building one-off pipelines that cannot be supported or reused
- Over-centralizing at the expense of expertise  
- Optimizing for architectural elegance over delivery  
- Centralizing ownership without domain accountability  
- Chasing AI outcomes without first earning data trust

## Representative Initiatives

Examples of how this philosophy shows up in practice include:
- Establishing **trusted market and reference data products** with clear ownership and observability  
- Implementing proactive **data quality and lineage systems** tied to business-critical datasets  
- Enabling governed self-service analytics through shared platforms and templates  
- Designing reproducible analytics workflows that bridge research and production
